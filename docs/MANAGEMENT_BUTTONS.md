# Management Buttons Guide

## Overview

The search page now has comprehensive management buttons for both AI text descriptions and CLIP image embeddings. These make it easy to keep your database synchronized and up-to-date.

## Button Sections

### 1. AI Text Descriptions

Generates detailed text descriptions using Watsonx AI.

**Buttons:**

- **Process New Items** - Generate descriptions only for items without AI descriptions
- **Force Regenerate All** - Regenerate descriptions for ALL items (uses API credits)

**When to use:**

- After adding new images to `data/assets/`
- When you want to update descriptions with newer AI models

---

### 2. CLIP Image Embeddings

Manages visual embeddings for fast and accurate image search.

**Buttons:**

- **ðŸ”„ Sync New Images** - Scan assets folder and add any new images to database
- **Generate Embeddings** - Generate CLIP embeddings only for items without embeddings
- **Force Regenerate All** - Regenerate embeddings for ALL items

**When to use:**

#### Sync New Images

- **Always run this first** after adding images to `data/assets/`
- Scans the assets folder and adds any new images to the database
- Creates basic database entries (descriptions will say "pending")
- Quick operation (milliseconds)

#### Generate Embeddings

- After syncing new images
- Generates CLIP embeddings for items that don't have them yet
- Takes a few seconds per image (first time loads the 605MB model)
- Required for CLIP image search to work

#### Force Regenerate All

- When you want to update embeddings with a newer CLIP model
- If embeddings got corrupted
- Generally not needed unless there's a specific reason

## Typical Workflow

### Adding New Images

```
1. Add images to data/assets/ folder
2. Click "ðŸ”„ Sync New Images"
   â†’ Adds items to database
3. Click "Generate Embeddings"
   â†’ Creates CLIP embeddings
4. (Optional) Click "Process New Items" in AI Text Descriptions
   â†’ Generates detailed AI descriptions
```

### Current Status

After running the workflow above:

- **11 items** in database
- **11 CLIP embeddings** (100% coverage)
- Image search is **fully functional**

## API Endpoints

For developers who want to automate:

```bash
# Sync new images
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/sync-assets

# Generate embeddings (new items only)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate-embeddings \
  -F "force=false"

# Force regenerate all embeddings
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate-embeddings \
  -F "force=true"

# Generate AI descriptions (new items only)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/reprocess-descriptions \
  -F "force=false"
```

## Technical Details

### What Sync Does

1. Scans `data/assets/` for image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp)
2. Compares against existing items in database
3. Adds new entries with:
   - Auto-generated ID (asset_001, asset_002, etc.)
   - Placeholder description
   - Basic metadata (color: "Various", material: "Mixed", etc.)
   - **No CLIP embedding yet** (needs separate generation)

### What Generate Embeddings Does

1. Loads CLIP model (once, ~1-2 seconds)
2. For each item without embedding:
   - Opens the image
   - Encodes to 512-dimensional vector
   - Saves to database
3. Model stays loaded between items (efficient batch processing)

### Performance

- **Sync:** ~5-10ms per image
- **Embedding Generation:** ~50-200ms per image (after model load)
- **Force Regenerate:** Same as above, but processes all items

## Troubleshooting

### "No items found to process"

- All items already have embeddings/descriptions
- Use force regenerate if you want to update anyway

### Image search not finding new images

1. Check database has the item: Look at search results count
2. Run "Sync New Images" if item is missing
3. Run "Generate Embeddings" if item exists but no results

### Model loading takes too long

- First time loads 605MB model (1-2 minutes on slow connection)
- Subsequent runs are fast (model is cached)
- Consider moving to GPU for 10x speed boost
